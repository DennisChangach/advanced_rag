# Advanced RAG
RAGs(Retrieval-Augmented Generation) are a great way to improve the  performance of LLM applications especially using domain-specific content. An example of a  simple RAG application is Q&A chatbot based on a knowledge base such as PDFs. 

The retrieval component entails finding relevant information while the generation component creates responses using that information. 

This series goes through the various advanced RAG techniques. 
- Query Translation e.g. Multi_Query, RAG Fusion
- Routing e.g. logical routing, semantic routing
- Query Construction
- Indexing
- Retrieval
- Generation
